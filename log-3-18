In reduced-units:

				*Isotropic*
	-switched to 256 particles
	-running 300000 timesteps for stability with no anisotropy
	-appears liquid, but kinetic energy and temperature are off
	-changing pcorf for 256 particles
	-changed potential to not use pow()
	-definitely need to check the units...****
		+the temperature looks like it should work but it is O(10^-2)
	-energy is not even relatively constant

	-stable for 300000 timesteps
	-pcf looks liquid despite the mixup

	-trying reduced units
		*mass=1 m_PAA
		*length=1 sigma
		*energy=1 epsilon
	-stable for: 1000,10000
	-energy is about as constant as with non-reduced units
	-scaled boltzmann constant
	-upon visual inspection appears to be a gas w/ T*=3
	-temperature seems more correct after change
	-PCF is seriously off not even gaseous
	-*fixed definitely gas
	-reducing temperature and attempting to produce liquid state
	-at T=2.5 appears stable & energy fluctuations same
	-still fgas
	-T=2.0 still gas
	-T=1.5 still gas
	-T=1.25 still gas
	-T=1.10 still gas it appears tthat the density is wrong
	-T=1.0 still gas
	-T=0.75 liquid forming
	-T=0.5 energy fluctuations less
	-T=0.5 l=9.2~ -> l=8.5 : more energy fluctuations, pcf cleaning up
	-T=0.5 l=8.0 : same
	-T=0.5 l=6.8 pcf shaping up
	
	-introducing anisotropy kappa 2:1 kappaP 2:1
	-nan's across the board
	-i jacked up the length scale and the nans went away...
	i have a feeling i'm just missing something that is jacking some of 
	the forces up
	-the force is relatively large in the direction that the particles
	are aligned
